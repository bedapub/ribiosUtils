# Cut a vector of numbers into interval factors.

Three types of labels (levels) are supported: “cut.default” (Interval
labels returned by `cut` as default), “left” (Left boundary of
intervals), and “right” (Right boundary of intervals).

## Usage

``` r
cutInterval(
  x,
  step = 1,
  labelOption = c("cut.default", "left", "right"),
  include.lowest = FALSE,
  right = TRUE,
  dig.lab = 3,
  ordered_result = FALSE,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A vector of numbers

- step:

  Step size.

- labelOption:

  How is the label displayed.See `details` section.

- include.lowest:

  Logical, passed to `cut`

- right:

  Logial, passed to `cut`

- dig.lab:

  See [`cut`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/cut.html)

- ordered_result:

  See [`cut`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/cut.html)

- ...:

  Other parameters that are passed to
  [`cut`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/cut.html)

## Value

A vector of factors
